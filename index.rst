Cangjie and Quick, now in IBus
==============================

IBus Cangjie is an engine for the `IBus framework`_, implementing the
`Cangjie`_ and `Quick`_ input methods.

We believe in the value of sharing our work with the rest of the world, which
is why IBus Cangjie is Free Software, under the `GNU LGPLv3+ license`_.

To make it as easy as possible to start using IBus Cangjie, we compiled the
installation instructions on :doc:`a dedicated page <install>`.

IBus Cangjie is providing :doc:`a great user experience <discover>` already,
but if you find a bug, be sure to `report it`_.

If you have a question, be sure to check our :doc:`FAQ <faq>`. If you can't
find the answer, just :ref:`ask us <talk-to-us>`!
