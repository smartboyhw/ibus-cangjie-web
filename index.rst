Cangjie and Quick, now in IBus
==============================

IBus Cangjie is an engine for the `IBus framework`_, implementing the
`Cangjie`_ and `Quick`_ input methods, as used in Hong Kong to input
Traditional Chinese.

.. note:: IBus Cangjie is still in its early days. It contains bugs, we know
          of a few bad ones, so don't expect miracles. However, we'll be happy
          to receive your feedback, and any help is welcome to make it better!

We strongly believe in the value of sharing our work with the rest of the
world, which is why IBus Cangjie is Free Software, under the
`GNU GPLv3+ license`_.

To make it as easy as possible to start using IBus Cangjie, we compiled the
installation instructions on :doc:`a dedicated page <install>`.

IBus Cangjie aims to provide :doc:`a great user experience <discover>`, but
if you find a bug, be sure to `report it`_.
